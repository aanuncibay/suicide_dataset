By then the cops had already taken him to the hospital but me and a friend went and hung out with him. Also been there to help try and talk him down. Another person I hadnt been friends with for years cause of some stuff called me out of the blue on thankgiving last year. I called back and got a hospital number so I knew something was up. Ended up being a kid who I was friends with years before but was a huge douche to me. He was in the psych ward for trying to kill himself. I got a hold of him and talked to him for a while. Whenever he would call I would answer and be there even though I still had the shit from years earlier on my mind. There are people that I might not want to be around but if it's a situation like this I'll be there for people. My goal or purpose in life that's sustained my survival is to help make other peoples lives a little bit better. Make people laugh when they're sad, help people out when nobody else will. Basically treat other humans even strangers with the respect and kindness of a friend. That's all people need sometime. Let people talk through their shit with me and offer helpful advice if I can. I'm still swimming in my own shit but that's enough to keep me going, keep that little light at the end of the tunnel switched on. Idk how long that will last but I'll be here till it flickers out.\n",
